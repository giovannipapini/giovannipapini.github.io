# My Expertise

I'm a Data Engineer, former Data Scientist, Data Analyst, Data *Something*. I always have been interested in Data Engineering/Science as a way to combine statistical modeling and technical expertise for process support and optimization. I achieved a MSc in Statistics at the University of Florence and implemented models to be applied both in banking and industrial context.
